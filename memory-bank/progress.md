# Progress Tracking: OneNote Integration

## Completed

- Initial project structure analyzed
- Integration design documented
- Implementation plan created

## In Progress

Integration phase:

- OneNote service implemented with proper Graph API formatting
- StandupGroup updated to use OneNote page IDs
- Standup class modified to persist summaries

## To Do

### Core Service

- [x] Create OneNoteService class
- [x] Implement Graph client initialization
- [x] Add authentication handling
- [x] Create retry mechanism
- [x] Build HTML templating system

### Integration

- [x] Update StandupGroup with OneNote metadata
- [x] Modify closeStandup to use OneNote service
- [x] Add error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Implement concurrent update handling

### Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for OneNoteService
- [ ] Integration tests for standup flow
- [ ] Error scenario testing

## Known Issues

Implementation complete with following considerations:

- OneNote service uses Graph API's proper HTML presentation format
- Error handling with retry mechanism
- Graceful degradation when OneNote updates fail
- Standup functionality preserved with chat summaries

## Blockers

1. Need to integrate with StandupGroup
2. Need to test with actual OneNote pages
3. Need to implement concurrent update handling

## Next Up

1. Implement concurrent update handling
2. Add testing suite
3. Document usage examples
4. Add integration tests

## Notes

- Critical to maintain atomic updates
- Need to handle connection issues gracefully
- Important to preserve existing standup functionality
