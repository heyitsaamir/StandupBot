# Active Context: OneNote Integration Implementation

## Current Focus

Implementing OneNote integration for standup persistence

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: OneNote Service Setup

1. Create OneNoteService class

   - Graph client initialization
   - Authentication setup
   - Basic CRUD operations

2. Define HTML Templates
   - Create standup summary template
   - Structure for updates and parking lot
   - Date-based organization

### Phase 2: Integration

1. Update StandupGroup

   - Add OneNote page metadata
   - Implement persistence methods
   - Add error handling

2. Modify closeStandup Flow
   - Format summary for OneNote
   - Implement retry logic
   - Add fallback mechanism

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation

1. Unit Tests

   - OneNote service methods
   - Template generation
   - Error scenarios

2. Integration Tests
   - End-to-end standup flow
   - Persistence verification
   - Error recovery

## Questions to Resolve

1. Authentication

   - Should tokens be managed by the service or injected?
   - What's the token refresh strategy?
   - How to handle auth errors?

2. Content Management
   - How to handle concurrent updates?
   - What's the strategy for content conflicts?
   - How to manage page size over time?

## Next Steps

1. Implement OneNoteService class
2. Create authentication mechanism
3. Build HTML templating system
4. Integrate with existing StandupGroup class
5. Add error handling and retry logic
6. Implement tests

## Dependencies Required

```json
{
  "@microsoft/graph-client": "^3.0.0",
  "@azure/identity": "^2.0.0",
  "retry": "^0.13.0"
}
```
